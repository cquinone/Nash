need separate images for direction facing (to prevent weird image flip junk) 
need sep images for frames of walk -> each dir too



jan 29
----------------------
set new dirs for air movement, so like if jump or maybe non-0 yvel
-> then use same images but slower side speed (more realistic)
99,4,4 -> rgb brown
255,224,189 -> rgb white skin

keep side move on jump without hold?
maybe make not lower x speed in air, but x speed that decays somehow...

jan 30
---------------------
masking sizes:
from 5 to 19 for idle side x range
from 0 to 34 for idle side y range
from 4 to 18 for walk side x range
from 0 to 34 for walk side y range

somehow adjust key capture to check which was pressed most recently, then override with that one
or maybe like if you get to right and left is still pressed (no unpress?) then override?

jan 31
---------------------
need buffer on masks? that way can't "fall" into it
^right now, getting stuck when trying to jump out of block
or change falling to make sure you never have y corrds that dip into block (somehow do now)

Might be that need masks and check for jump/fall state
--> implement those too and check


feb 1
---------------------
set up level manager, change level class to actually be instaces of each specific level
---> maybe not though, to save bounding box
fix images (clean off odd color), check if background will mess with them
maybe shift block or nash mask inward to stop weird side collisions
STILL HAVENT FIXED LEFT/RIGHT ISSUES
make lvl draw specific func (update too?) -> will be able to draw moving blocks
--> moving blocks need way to deal with player interactions, will need to also update moving block masks
--> so like add moving bool to block class

prevent jumping out of fall? maaaybe-> makes falling worse
--> maybe not, nice way to save self
