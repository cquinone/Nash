set new dirs for air movement, so like if jump or maybe non-0 yvel
-> then use same images but slower side speed (more realistic)
99,4,4 -> rgb brown
255,224,189 -> rgb white skin

keep side move on jump without hold?
maybe make not lower x speed in air, but x speed that decays somehow...

jan 30
---------------------
masking sizes:
from 5 to 19 for idle side x range
from 0 to 34 for idle side y range
from 4 to 18 for walk side x range
from 0 to 34 for walk side y range

somehow adjust key capture to check which was pressed most recently, then override with that one
or maybe like if you get to right and left is still pressed (no unpress?) then override?

jan 31
---------------------
need buffer on masks? that way can't "fall" into it
^right now, getting stuck when trying to jump out of block
or change falling to make sure you never have y corrds that dip into block (somehow do now)

Might be that need masks and check for jump/fall state
--> implement those too and check


feb 1
---------------------
maybe shift block or nash mask inward to stop weird side collisions
--> moving blocks need way to deal with player interactions, will need to also update moving block masks
--> so like add moving bool to block class

prevent jumping out of fall? maaaybe-> makes falling worse
--> maybe not, nice way to save self
add timer drawn on lvl1 and beyond --> part of initialized parent class
--> just add to draw method?
Add the nash vs pic somehow --> maybe end screen if you lose?


feb 2
---------------------
game runs oddly --> trying to make it 60 fps and you get like 44
--> how to track one second passing?
one prized possession per level -> bonuses? time bonuses?
--> possible prized possessions: ___

feb 4
---------------------
smoke puff, ladder, FBI, ... -> objects to collide with
collide func handles blocks + walls
sep func for above?
or put object cover loop in update pos?
go with SEP FUNC
